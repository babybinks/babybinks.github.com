        <h3>Backstory</h3>
            
           <p>BabyBinks is a creator of educational children's application for the iPhone,
            iPad and iPod touch.  It was founded 2009 by a dad who couldn't find a decent
            baby naming iPhone app and set out to make one (remember this was 2009). There
            are currently 9,292 baby name apps in the App Store.  The app was finished
            3 months <em>after</em> the birth of his third child.  He ended up being named the
            old fashioned way...by letting his 3 year old sister pick the name.  She
            was watching Sesame Street at the time, so his name is Oscar.</p>
        
            <p>BabyBinks has created 9 apps and has the distinction of each one being featured
            by Apple.  This include the coveted front page feature on iTunes.</p>

            <!--iPhone applications for modern families. Come on and join the
            party; there's stroller parking in the back, a changing table in the bathroom,
            and cold beer behind the breast milk in the fridge.
            
            <h2>In Real-Life</h2>
            Taglines aside, BabyBinks is the website of Andrew Binkowski. What started as a
            blog to keep friends and family updated on our children, has exploded into a
            commentary on modern fatherhood. With a subscription base that includes a comma,
            its just a little place on the Internet to visit when you are one diaper change
            away from telling your family you're going out for a pack of cigarrettes and not
            coming home until you son signs a major league baseball contract.
            
            <h2>Cliffs Notes on BabyBinks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have 3 kids, ages 4, 2, and 1. I use fake names in the posts so as not to make it easier to abduct them.
                    <li>My wife and I have been married for 8 (I think) years. We met in college.
                        <li>I'm a re-relapsed Catholic. Who doesn't start going to church again after the "+" sign appears on a pregnancy test? We go to church every week, but I still don't pay attention and I let my kids color the whole time. My wife prays for all of us.
                            <li>We've had all of our kids in daycare since they were 3 months old...but we still love them.
                                The daycare is at my work, so I get to eat lunch everyday with my kids.
                                
                                <h2>What's With All the iPhone Stuff</h2>
                                My wife and I have iPhones. We wanted to find a good baby naming application, we
                                couldn't find one so I wrote one. We wanted to help our daughter learn to read,
                                so I wrote another one.  And so on and so on...
